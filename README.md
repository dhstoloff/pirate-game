# pirate-game
A visualization of the classic "pirate game", a mathematical ultimatum puzzle. 
The pirate game involves a group of blood thirsty pirates, who while blood thirsty are very logical.
They have a very strict seniority, with one pirate as captain, then a co-captain, and so on. 
When they find gold the captain proposes a plan to split it up and then the pirates vote. If the plan doesn't get at least half the votes
the captain is killed and the process repeats with the next in line.
The pirates always vote with the following rules:
1. They will always vote to save themselves 
2. They will always vote to get the most gold
3. They will always vote to kill if it doesn't effect their own life or gold.
